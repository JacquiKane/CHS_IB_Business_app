        <h3>5.1 Introduction to operations management</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_operations_management"
            >Operations managment </a
          >plays a pivotal role in the functioning of businesses, serving as the
          engine behind transforming inputs into valuable outputs that generate
          revenue. It encompasses decisions and actions aimed at efficiently
          managing resources, processes, and systems to ensure the smooth flow
          of operations. One aspect involves deciding whether to handle
          operations internally or outsource them, balancing factors like
          control and expertise. Moreover, operations management intertwines
          with sustainability efforts, responding to stakeholder demands for
          transparency and responsible resource use. This includes adopting
          <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_circular_economy"
            >circular economy</a
          >
          and business models, which focus on reducing waste and promoting
          environmental sustainability. Successful examples like Ikea and
          Starbucks demonstrate the efficacy of integrating sustainability into
          operations. Thus, the role of operations management extends beyond
          mere production; it entails steering businesses towards profitability,
          efficiency, and environmental responsibility in a cohesive manner.

        <h3>5.2 Operations Methods</h3>
        <p>
          In determining the most appropriate production method for an
          organization, several factors must be considered.<a
            href="#"
            class="keyterm"
            id="id_jobProduction"
            >Job production</a
          >
          is often favored for niche markets with specific customer
          requirements, as it allows for the creation of unique products
          tailored to individual specifications. Conversely,
          <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_batchProduction">Production</a>
          offers flexibility and customization within consignments, making it
          suitable for larger production runs that require some degree of
          variation.<a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_flowProduction"
            >Flow production</a
          >
          is best suited for high-volume standard products with limited variety,
          while<a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_massCustomization"
            >Mass customization</a
          >
          combines mass production with flexibility to offer personalized
          products on a large scale.The choice of method ultimately depends on
          market characteristics such as size and demand predictability. For
          instance, flow production and mass customization are cost-effective
          options for markets with large and predictable sales, while job
          production and batch production cater to smaller, niche markets and
          allow for customization. However, implementing these methods requires
          considerations such as coordination, monitoring, technological
          investment, and alignment with information systems. The selected
          method impacts factors like economies of scale, HR management, and
          technology integration, influencing the organization's overall
          efficiency and competitiveness. Therefore, the most appropriate method
          is determined by a careful assessment of market dynamics and
          production needs, ensuring alignment with the organization's goals and
          objectives.

        <h3>5.3 Lean production and quality management (HL only)</h3>
        <p>
          Less waste and greater efficiency in production refer to minimizing
          unnecessary resources and activities, enhancing productivity, and
          reducing costs. Lean production, a method aimed at achieving these
          goals, involves strategies like just-in-time (JIT) production and
          cradle-to-cradle design, focusing on sustainability and resource
          optimization.
          <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_qualityControl">Quality control</a>
          and
          <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_qualityAssurance"
            >quality assurance</a
          >
          are vital aspects of lean production and
          <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_totalQualityManagement"
            >total quality management (TQM)</a
          >, ensuring consistent product quality. Methods such as
          <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_qualityCircles">quality circles</a>
          and
          <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_benchmarking">benchmarking</a> aid
          in managing quality effectively, fostering employee empowerment and
          continuous improvement. Implementing lean production and TQM
          profoundly impacts organizational culture, structure, and leadership,
          emphasizing collaboration and customer satisfaction. Adhering to
          national and international quality standards, like ISO 9001,
          reinforces product quality and builds trust with customers. In
          summary, integrating lean production and quality management enhances
          efficiency, reduces waste, maintains high-quality standards, and
          fosters
          <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_continuousImprovement"

        <h3>5.4 Location</h3>
        <p>
          The selection of a production location is influenced by various
          factors, including cost, proximity to resources, and market access.
          Companies may opt for<a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_outsourcing"
            >outsourcing</a

          or
          <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_subcontracting">subtracting</a> to
          leverage external expertise or lower labor costs.
          <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_offshoring">Offshoring</a> involves
          relocating production to another country to benefit from lower labor
          costs or access to new markets. Conversely,
          <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_reshoring">reshoring</a> refers to
          bringing production back to the home country, often due to rising
          costs or quality concerns associated with offshoring.
          <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_inshoring">Inshoring</a> involves
          internalizing production processes to maintain control over quality
          and intellectual property. Reorganizing production nationally or
          internationally requires careful consideration of factors such as
          labor laws, infrastructure, and supply chain efficiency to optimize
          cost-effectiveness and competitiveness.

        <h3>5.6 Production planning (HL Only)</h3>
        <p>
          Organizations strive to make the most efficient use of their stock of
          raw materials, finished products and fixed capital. Production
          planning is concerned with how raw materials are used, and it is
          important to have sufficient quantities to ensure the smooth running
          of the production process. The
          <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_localSupplyChain"
            >local supply chain</a
          >
          is the full production and distribution process in close proximity to
          an organization. The
          <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_globalSupplyChain"
            >global supply chain</a
          >
          contains more intermediaries between the primary producer and the
          final consumer, extending over a range of countries. The supply chain
          process highlights all the intermediaries involved in the production
          process, from the primary producer through to the customer.
          <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_labourProductivity"

          are all used to highlight the productivity rates of an organization.
          Some production planning decisions include whether to buy in or make
          components or finished products. The decision to buy in or make is a
          complex one and show not merely be reduced to cost savings. There are
          many additional factors to consider, which are both qualitative and
          quantitative.

        <h3>5.7 Crisis Management and contingency planning (HL only)</h3>
        <p>
          Crisis management manages a crisis after it has occurred in real time,
          without having undertaken sufficient long-term strategic planning.
          Contingency Planning allows for the fact that a crisis could occur
          under different scenarios and tries to plan accordingly. The three
          factors that affect crisis management are speed, transparency, and
          control & communication. Contingency planning is always a risk as the
          event may never happen. Significant resources can be committed to
          contingency planning without a return. The challenge for organizations
          is can they take that risk?

        <h3>5.8 Research and Development (HL only)</h3>
        <p>
          Successful Research and Development can lead to increased revenue and
          market share. It could also include new production methods, customer
          service programmes, innovative ways of structuring or financing an
          organization, achieving new levels of quality assurance and further
          opportunities for cost reduction and/or productivity gains. An
          organization’s survival may depend on its capacity for
          <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_innovation">innovation</a>. We live
          in an era of new products and services that on first viewing may not
          have been considered valuable or even perceived as a need. Innovations
          like the motor car, streaming sites like iTunes, or plant-based meat
          products. For competitive reasons especially, creating new needs is of
          paramount importance even if initial consumer confusion is evident.
          R&D, invention, and risk taking by an entrepreneur requires some form
          of legal protection because thought would discourage even more R&D if
          they could not see the profits of their labor. Things like privacy and
          copyright infringement could threaten the economic stability of a
          whole industry. Incremental innovation is a series of small
          improvements made to a product or service. An example would be the
          iPhone with a new model that comes out every year. Disruptive
          innovation is when an innovation alerts stakeholders behavior and they
          are reluctant to return to traditional methods of carrying out an
          activity. An example of this is with Amazon's e-commerce tactics that
          forced other companies to adapt.
