            <h2>2.1: Human Resource Management</h2>

            <h3>Internal vs. External factors</h3>
            
            <p>External factors such as demographic changes require new HR strategies. Changes such as birth rates and labour has fallen drastically, while HR 
                must also account for the nature of business changing into a "<span class="keyterm"id="id_24/7 economy"><a href="#">24/7 economy</a></span>"  ,which describes 
                a market that is constantly active in sectors such as labour, trading and purchasing.
            </p>

            <p>Internal factors such as rising labour costs, fluctuating demand, and the increasing use of cloud software
                has led employers to change hiring practices, and move away from the 9-5 structure.
            </p>

            <h3>Resistance To Change</h3>

            <p>The force pushing towards improvement and goals is known as a <span class="keyterm"id="id_driving force"><a href="#" >driving force</a></span>,while 
                anything causing resistance is known as a <span class="keyterm"id="id_restraining force"> <a href="#" >restraining force.</a></span>
            </p>

            <p>When new <span class ="keyterm" id= "id_strategy"><a href="#" >strategy</a></span>, which is a set of actions, ideals, and objectives, is implemented at the top, 
                misunderstandings and fear of mistakes or change can cause issues in morale, ultimately effecting productivity.

            <h2>2.2: Organizational structure</h2>

            <p><span class ="keyterm" id="Centralization"><a href="#" >Centralization</a></span> is a structure where decisions are reserved to top execs, usually utilized in 
                small-scale organizations. <span class="keyterm"id="id_Bureaucracy"><a href= "#" >Bureaucracy</a></span> is a complex structure emphasizing hierarchies, coordination, 
                and protocols. It is widely utilized in large organizations. These are two popular organizational structures, but a Matrix structure (a combination of 
                characteristics from other structurs) has been commonly implemented. <p><span class="keyterm"id="Chain of command"><a href="#" >Chain of command</a></span>is a 
                structure which determines who answers to who, starting with the CEO and trickles down for each level of employment.
               <span class="keyterm"id="id_Delegation of responsibility"> <a href="#" >Delegation of responsibility</a></span> is the transferral of
                responsibility for a task to another individual, who is typically lower down the chain of command. Hierarchies are 
                present in all organizational structures, but are different in each one.
            </p>


            <h3>Structure Apropiateness</h2>

            <p>When outside forces change such as market competetition and social/tech advancements are considered,
                different structures become more appropiate than others and organizations must analyze their sitiuation and alter their strategy.
            </p>

            <p>One of the biggest examples of this is Google in 2015, when analyzations showed the company was losing creativity and innovation 
                they restructured into Alphabet, allowing for a clearer and more effective hierarchy.
